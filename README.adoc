= Asset Bundle

The Asset Bundle of the Enginiro project provides implementation of a
https://symfony.com/doc/4.4/components/asset.html#versioned-assets[version strategy]
that accepts a JSON manifest file.

== Usage

To use this bundle, require it in your `composer.json` file. By default, the
version strategy will look for the manifest file in
`var/dat/asset-hashes.json`. This can be customized by setting the
`enginiro_asset.manifest_path` configuration option.

== Manifest

The manifest file must be a JSON object, where keys are asset paths and values
their hash. Paths must not begin with a slash.

For example:

[source,json]
----
{
	"assets/css/stylesheet.css": "abcd12345",
	"assets/js/script.js": "defg67890"
}
----

This format works well with the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-buster[`gulp-buster`] package.
